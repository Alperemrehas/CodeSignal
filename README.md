# CodeSignal Code Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various code challenges from CodeSignal. CodeSignal is a platform that offers coding assessments and challenges to help improve programming skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate Python files, each representing a different code challenge. The description of each challenge is provided as commented-out text within the respective Python file.

Here's a list of the challenges I have solved so far:

- [AvoidObstacles](./AvoidObstacles.py)
- [BoxBlur](./BoxBlur.py)
- [Minesweeper](./Minesweeper.py)
- [Array_Replace](./Array_Replace.py)

Feel free to explore the solutions and read the challenge descriptions directly in the Python files.

## Contributing
